/**
 * Pure logic behind the positions (cast votes) explorer.
 *
 * Kept out of the component so the honesty rules below are testable on their
 * own. Three of them are load-bearing:
 *
 *  1. Every optional field on `GovVote` is treated as ABSENT until proven
 *     present. Production's projection is not confirmed to carry `votedAt`,
 *     `rationaleUrl`, `hasScript` or the role-agnostic `voterId`, so absence
 *     hides the affordance rather than rendering a blank or a zero.
 *  2. Identity is matched on the DRep CREDENTIAL, never on the display string.
 *     The wallet holds one id form and a vote row may carry another.
 *  3. A truncated list cannot prove a vote is absent. "Your DRep has not voted"
 *     is a claim about the user, and it is only made from a complete list.
 *
 * EXISTENCE and RENDERABILITY are also kept apart, because conflating them
 * publishes a false number: roughly a quarter of published rationales are
 * `ipfs://`, which is a real rationale that this wallet cannot turn into a safe
 * href. Counting only the linkable ones reported those voters as having
 * published nothing.
