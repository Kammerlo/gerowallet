/**
 * Off-chain governance assets: DRep avatars and CIP-136 rationale documents.
 *
 * Both are author-hosted, so both arrive as a URI the wallet did not choose, and
 * roughly a quarter of them are `ipfs://`. Two DIFFERENT URLs come out of the
 * same input here, and conflating them is the bug this module exists to prevent:
 *
 *  - {@link toInAppUrl} is what the extension page itself loads (an `<img>` src,
 *    a `fetch`). An `ipfs://` URI cannot be one, and neither can a public
 *    gateway URL: `ipfs.io`, Pinata and Cloudflare answer cross-origin extension
 *    requests with 403 plus `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`, which Chrome blocks
 *    outright (see `shared/utils/ipfs.ts`). That is precisely why so many DRep
 *    avatars render blank today. IPFS is content-addressed, so the same CID
 *    through gero-backend's own `/api/ipfs` proxy returns identical bytes from
 *    an origin the extension is allowed to talk to — and the user's IP never
 *    reaches the gateway.
 *  - {@link toExternalHref} is what a NEW BROWSER TAB opens. No extension CSP
 *    applies there, so an `ipfs://` CID becomes an ordinary public gateway link.
 *
 * Everything is scheme-checked. `javascript:`, `data:` and every other scheme
 * resolve to null rather than being handed to an `<img>` or an `href`.
