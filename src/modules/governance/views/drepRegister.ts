/**
 * The whole DRep register, loaded once so the directory's columns can order it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The directory used to fetch one page of 15 and sort those 15 client side. A
 * header reading "Voting power ↓" therefore meant "the 15 rows you happen to be
 * looking at", which is a lie told by a control that looks authoritative. Two
 * different fixes are needed, because the columns split in two:
 *
 *  - Voting power and delegators are SERVER-sortable. `sortDirectory`'s
 *    `SERVER_SORT_BY` pushes them to `/api/dreps` as `sort_by`, the server orders
 *    all 1,682 rows, and normal paging walks that global order. No extra bytes.
 *  - Participation, rationale rate and last-vote recency are computed CLIENT side
 *    from each record's `votes[]` (see `drepStats`). gero-backend cannot order by
 *    them at all. The only truthful way to order the register by a figure the
 *    server does not hold is to hold the register.
 *
 * THE MEASUREMENT (mainnet, api.gerowallet.io, 2026-08-24)
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * Register:        1,682 DReps, 30,172 vote rows, 80,151 delegator rows.
 * `per_page`:      honoured up to at least 2,000 — no server clamp observed.
 * One walk @ 500:  4 requests, 10.74 MB gzipped on the wire (30.73 MB decoded),
 *                  1.9 s with pages 2..4 in parallel, 3.1 s strictly sequential.
 * One page @ 15:   0.32 MB gzipped, 0.34 s — the status quo, for comparison.
 * Single request:  `per_page=2000` returns all 1,682 in one response but takes
 *                  3.8–7.2 s, i.e. SLOWER than four smaller pages. Hence the walk.
 * Retained heap:   34.1 MB for the projection below (measured with --expose-gc).
 *                  Keeping the raw records instead costs roughly three times that,
 *                  because 68% of the payload is delegator identity and vote
 *                  transaction hashes that no directory column reads.
 *
 * THE CHOICE
 * ----------
 * 10.74 MB and ~2 s, once per chain/network, behind a visible loading state, is a
 * real cost but not an impractical one — `drepNames.ts` already spends the same
 * budget on the same endpoint merely to label rows on the positions tab, and this
 * buys the page's primary ordering. So the directory loads the whole register for
 * client-computed sorts (which includes the DEFAULT, participation) and pages it
 * in memory. Paging then costs nothing: page 3 is rows 31–45 of the global order,
 * not a fresh query against an unordered server page.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT ASSUMED
 * -------------------
 *  - That `sort_by` is validated upstream. It is NOT: `sort_by=participation` and
 *    `sort_by=garbage_key` both return HTTP 200 and the server's DEFAULT order,
 *    silently. A pass-through of the client's sort key would therefore render an
 *    arbitrary order under a header claiming to be sorted. `SERVER_SORT_BY` is an
 *    allow-list for exactly that reason.
 *  - That the walk succeeds. `complete: false` comes back whenever a page failed
 *    or the request budget ran out, and the caller must then say the order is
 *    page-local rather than imply a register-wide one.
 *  - That the ask was honoured. Page count prefers the server's own
 *    `meta.total_pages`, and otherwise divides by the rows page 1 ACTUALLY
 *    returned — the same rule, and for the same reason, as `drepNames.ts`.
