/**
 * The drawer's Governance section.
 *
 * It was a single expandable row with a submenu, and the submenu is what caused
 * the bug this module was first written for: standing on `/governance/dreps`
 * with the group collapsed, Actions was not gated — it simply was not in the
 * DOM, and no navigation inside the group could bring it back. Deriving the
 * open state fixed that; making the pages a SECTION of their own removes the
 * question. Every governance page is now a row like any other, always visible,
 * one click from anywhere.
 *
 * The list lives outside the SFC because two invariants ride on it and both are
 * cheap to break in a merge:
 *
 *  - Every link must be a route the router actually declares. The DRep
 *    directory was lost to a merge once already, and a nav row pointing at
 *    nothing looks identical to one that is merely unreachable.
 *  - Only registration rides the voting sub-flag. It posts a deposit and a
 *    certificate on chain, so it is gated on top of the master governance gate
 *    — and the router gates the same route the same way. A row visible here
 *    that the router redirects away from is worse than no row at all.
