/**
 * TypeScript mirrors of Nexus's Cardano governance DTOs.
 *
 * Two conventions to keep straight:
 *  - These come from NEXUS via the gero-backend proxy and are camelCase.
 *  - gero-backend's own /api/dreps (blockchain-api.ts) is snake_case.
 *
 * Every `BigInteger` field arrives as a JSON number and is converted to a
 * decimal STRING by `parseBigJson` before it reaches this layer, so those
 * fields are typed `string`. Pass them through `toLovelace()` — never
 * `Number()`. Fields Nexus types as `Double` (the `*Pct` family) are genuinely

 *  1. It is the member's COLD credential (`1980dbf1…`, `credType: SCRIPTHASH`).
 *     A committee VOTE carries the HOT one (`voterHash: 2ea7a78e…`,
 *     `voterId: cc_hot1…`), and the two are different key hashes — the eight
 *     current members and the committee rows on
 *     `529dccaa…#0` overlap on exactly ZERO hashes. So a vote row only resolves
 *     to a member once upstream publishes the hot credential (or the name) on a
 *     surface that carries it. Until then the row renders its truncated hash,
 *     which is the honest answer; nothing may guess a name by position.
 *  2. The set is the CURRENT committee. A member whose term expired before the
 *     action may legitimately have voted and be absent here.
