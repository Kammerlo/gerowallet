/**
 * Health of the DRep a wallet has delegated its voting power to.
 *
 * Pure over its arguments: this module NEVER fetches and reads no ambient
 * clock. The caller supplies the DRep record (gero-backend
 * `GET /api/dreps/{id}`, snake_case), the current epoch
 * (`networkStore.getCurrentEpoch()`) and optionally the wall time (`nowSec`),
 * so the same maths is reusable from a view, from an alert evaluator, and from
 * a test with no store at all.
 *
 * The CIP-1694 / Conway-ledger facts that drive everything here:
 *
 *  - A DRep that neither votes nor submits a DRep update certificate for
 *    `drep_activity` epochs stops counting: "Inactive DReps do not count
 *    towards the active voting stake anymore, and can become active again ...
 *    by voting on any governance actions or submitting a DRep update
 *    certificate" (CIP-1694). That exclusion is why the warning exists at all.
 *  - A stored expiry is NOT a clean countdown. Epochs with no open proposals
 *    are dormant (`numDormantEpochs`) and do not consume the window, but the
 *    accrued credit is only folded into stored expiries when the NEXT proposal
 *    is submitted (cardano-ledger, Certs.hs `updateDormantDRepExpiry`). During
 *    a proposal drought an indexer's `expires_epoch_no` can therefore sit in
 *    the past for a DRep that has missed nothing. A past expiry is evidence of
 *    inactivity, never proof.
 *  - What refreshes the expiry: the DRep's own votes (Certs.hs,
 *    `updateVotingDRepExpiries`) and its registration/update certificates
 *    (GovCert.hs). A delegator's vote-delegation certificate does NOT.
 *
 * Hence the trust hierarchy `delegationHealth` implements, strongest first:
 *
 *  1. `registered: false` is retirement. Permanent, outranks everything.
 *  2. An explicit `active` flag is the indexer's own verdict and beats any
 *     arithmetic done here on `expires_epoch_no`. `active: true` beside an
 *     already-passed expiry is a self-contradiction: the expiry is provably
 *     stale, so the countdown is discarded (`expiryStale`) instead of being
 *     rendered as "0 left".
 *  3. With no `active` flag, expiry arithmetic may conclude "expired", but a
 *     vote younger than the activity window vetoes it: a vote fully resets the
 *     window and dormancy only ever ADDS credit, so expiry after a recent vote
 *     is impossible. The veto needs wall time, so it runs only when the caller
 *     passes `nowSec`.
 *
 * `n/a` is not `0`. A DRep with no votes has NO rationale rate — reporting 0%
 * would accuse them of withholding rationales they were never asked for. Those
 * fields are `null` and the UI must render them as "n/a".
