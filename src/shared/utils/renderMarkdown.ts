/**
 * Safe markdown -> HTML, injected via `v-html`.
 *
 * SAFETY MODEL (do not change the order): ALL input is HTML-escaped FIRST, then
 * a small markdown subset is rendered on the escaped text. Nothing an author
 * wrote can ever reach the DOM as markup — the only tags in the output are the
 * ones this file constructs itself.
 *
 * Author input reaches the output as escaped TEXT, which is the whole design,
 * and in attribute VALUES, which is where the care goes. Those values are not
 * all alike: one carries the author's own bytes and two are numbers this file
 * computes from a match. All three are listed, with the reason each is safe,
 * above `REFERENCE_MARKER_ATTR`. Read that list before adding an attribute, and
 * extend it when you do.
 *
 * Both callers hand this function text they do not control:
 *  - agent chat replies (a token name inside an LLM answer), and
 *  - CIP-108 governance metadata, which is off-chain JSON authored by whoever
 *    submitted the proposal. Anyone can submit a governance action.
 *
 * Supported: headings (# .. ######), bold (**), inline code (`), bullet and
 * numbered lists including nesting, blockquotes (>), horizontal rules, pipe
 * tables, links ([text](http(s)://...)), paragraphs with line breaks, and
 * optional `[n]` reference markers the caller opts into.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT supported:
 *  - italics: single-underscore/asterisk false-positives on token names and
 *    pool ids.
 *  - images: a remote `<img>` in wallet chrome is a tracking pixel and a CSP
 *    question, so `![alt](url)` degrades to its literal text — the whole
 *    `![alt](url)` string, visible and escaped. It is lifted out BEFORE the
 *    link rule runs so it cannot fall through into an anchor: silently turning
 *    an embed into an outbound link would manufacture a destination the author
 *    never wrote as one, and would leave a stray "!" in front of it. Literal
 *    text shows the reader exactly what the proposal actually says. A linked
 *    banner, `[![alt](img)](href)`, follows from the same two rules rather
 *    than being a case of its own: the anchor the author DID write survives,
 *    and its visible text is that literal image markdown.
 *  - raw HTML passthrough: that is the whole point of escaping first.

/**
 * Attribute an inline `[n]` marker carries its 1-based index in.
 *
 * The marker is a real `<button>`, not a link. A bare `#fragment` href is not
 * a same-document jump in this app: the extension runs a HASH-MODE router, so
 * clicking one REPLACES the route and reloading that address lands on the
 * wallet home instead of the proposal.
 *
 * ATTRIBUTE VALUES THAT VARY WITH AUTHOR INPUT. Three, and each is safe for its
 * own reason. All three reasons must keep holding; none of them covers another,
 * so weakening one is not paid for by the other two:
 *
 *  1. a link's `href` — the ONLY one that carries the author's own bytes. Two
 *     things make it safe. The link pattern admits nothing but an `http(s)://`
 *     URL, so no `javascript:` or `data:` value can reach it; and escaping ran
 *     first, so every `"` inside it is already `&quot;` and the value cannot
 *     close the quote it sits in. The same pattern also stops the destination
 *     at `<` or `>` so it cannot absorb this file's own markup — that one is
 *     about a correct destination rather than injection, and it is argued
 *     where `LINK` is built.
 *  2. this attribute, `data-md-ref` — written from a `\d{1,3}` match put
 *     through `Number()`. At most three DIGITS: it cannot contain a quote, a
 *     space or a letter at all, so there is nothing in it to escape.
 *  3. a heading's `class="md-h md-h{lvl}"` — `lvl` is the LENGTH of a `#{1,6}`
 *     run, so it is an integer 1..6 and never a substring of author text.
 *
 * Everything else this file writes as an attribute is a literal constant:
 * `target`, `rel`, `type`, `class="md-ref"` and `class="md-table"`. That list
 * and the three above are the whole set — `grep '="'` over this file to check
 * it after any change, because the next reader will trust what is written here.

 *     already in a slot by then, so a marker button is never nested inside an
 *     anchor, which would be a control inside a control.
 *  5. `[n]` markers, over what is left: plain text only.
 *
 * Restore is `restoreSlots`, which finishes each slot in ascending order and
 * then sweeps the document once. A slot CAN hold another slot — in
 * `[![alt](img)](href)`, a linked banner and ordinary in CIP-108 bodies, the
